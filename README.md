# ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
# I achieved using clerk as a way to allow the user to sign up and log in
# I achieved allowing the user to create posts using their clerkID
# User information is stored in a table in the database
# ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
# I was unable to create an error page
# ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
# I was sidetracked on other components so i was unable to fully complete all the user goals and strech goals, but i am pretty pleased with my website and i think it looks really nice and with a bit of polish it could be better.
# Clerk was a lot easier to use then supabase auth and emails but i found someone use OAuth using supabase and you can sign in using github, maybe i try to use that as well as clerk in another project for fun
